# Image Elements

## IMG tag

The image tag is a self closing tag because it has no text content, only the image that we point via the src (source) attribute.
```
<img src='url'/>
```

For testing purposes you could use [Picsum](https://picsum.photos) followed by width and height this way:
```
<img src='https://picsum.photos/200/300' />
```
to get a random image on your design meassuring 200 witdh and 300 height

The second attribute imperative on an image is the 'alt' attribute that gives an alternative description for visually impaired people

```
<img src='https://picsum.photos/200/300' alt='sunset in the forests'/>
```

To get a peak on how visually impaired people get your website you can use the [Silktide toolbar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/silktide-website-accessib/okcpiimdfkpkjcbihbmhppldhiebhhaf), a chrome extension that allows you to see the hidden content that visually impaired people get throught the screenreaders. Those descriptions are grabbed from the alt attributes of each image and you can inspect them in the developers tools via right click -> inspect element.
