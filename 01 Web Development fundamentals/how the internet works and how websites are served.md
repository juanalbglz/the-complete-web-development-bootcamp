The Internet is more like a wire than like a cloud. Attached to this wire are all computers. Some kind of computers that are working 24 hours online are called servers, while our pcs that connect to those 'servers' are called clients.

To connect to the internet we pass by a ISP (Internet Service Provider), that provides our entry point on the internet. When we connet to a website, let's say [Google](https://google.com) our client sends a request to a special server called DNS (Domain Name Server), that translates our name 'google' to a serie of numbers called 'IP address'. By checking on the site [nslookup.io](https://nslookup.io) we can do this step manually and then get to the IP adress for google directly, so lets try out!

Those cavles are also under the sea, and you can see them on [www.submarinecablemap.com](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/)
