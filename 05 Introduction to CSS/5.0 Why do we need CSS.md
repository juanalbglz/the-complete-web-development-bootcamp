# CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets 

On first HTML, there was no posibility to change default display of text and images, so [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) came out with [HTML 3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/SPSD-html32-20180315/) in January 1997 - that introduced new HTML tags as 
```
<font>
```
that allowed to change font-face color and size
```
<center>
```
that allowed to center the content.

CSS 1 was proposed on Dec 1996 to attach a Cascade Style Sheets and separate content from style.
