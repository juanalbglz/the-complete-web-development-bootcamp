Anchor elements is what gives the Hyper to the internet. Is the tag that allows to create hyperlinks that allows you to navigate to other documents on the internet.
The anchor element has an opening and a closing tag

For the anchor to work we need to add an additional attribute that goes in the
opening tag.

<tag attribute=value anotherattribute=value>content</tag>
```

```
<a href="https://document adress">Anchor Text</a>
```
