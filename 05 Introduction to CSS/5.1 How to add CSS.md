There are 3 different ways to add CSS to HTML
- Inline: assigned to each individual element. Difficult to maintain.
```
<html style="background: blue"></html>
```
- Internal: we can apply them to several elements at once, but live only in one HTML file.
```
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      html{
        background: blue;
       }
     </style>
  </head>
</html>
```
- External: External lives in a completely different file and can be applied to so many html as we need.
```
index.html
<html>
	<head>
	.
	.
	.
		<link
			rel="stylesheet"
			href='./style.css'
		/>
...

style.css
html{
	background: blue;
}
```
