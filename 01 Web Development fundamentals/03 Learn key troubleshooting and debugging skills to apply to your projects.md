Getting stuck with programming is almost a core part of the learning process in them you do get stuck and you get yourself unstuck.

Steps that you can go through when you get stuck on any sort of programming problem and the framework that you can use to get yourself unstuck in the quickest way possible.

1. Evaluate your expectation versus reality.
	Every time you run your code, think to yourself what do I expect to happen and then see what really happened and try to figure out what is causing the difference.
2. Try to figure out what is the error by searching for it in stackoverflow (via Google [[https://www.google.es/search?q=site%3Astackoverflow.com |Google]]
3. Rewatch the video to the point the code started breaking or running unexpected (Typos and misspellings).
4. Look for Q&A and look if others had the same issue. If not, share yours, so other in your place can profit from it. Include the timestamp of the video for others to help.
5. Ask questions following the four steps approach:
	1. What did you spect to happen?
	2. What actually happened?
	3. Include a screenshot of your code
	4. Include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors

To take a screenshot in windows (WIN+SHIFT+S) or in Mac (Apple + SHIFT + 4)
It's important to remember that everybody gets stuck sometimes and remember that getting stuck and solving it is all a part of the learning journey.
