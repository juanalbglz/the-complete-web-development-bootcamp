A website structure could seem like this folder tree.
We usually got a project folder in which we place all our project files. An index file as our home and default page in that folder and a folder for the assets (images and other media)
```
PROJECT FOLDER/
├─index.html
├─about.html
├─assets/
│  ├─ images/
│  │  ├─ cat.png
```
