HTML is the content of the house
CSS is the model of the parts, color of the walls...
JAVASCRIPT adds the functionallity to the all, giving electricity to the thing.

When getting the google site, our browser, Chrome add the chunks of data, first, the HTML, the text and the images, then the CSS to place every brick on its position, and then Javascript to allow us to search there.

Just go to google on chrome and right click on inspect over the search button to see the developer tools at the browser. On this tool, you can change values of the website to prank your friends, but this version wont get saved on the server, its just a local version.
