Multiple styles can be applied to an element, but the latest in the cascade is the one applied. That means an element can be affected by different CSS rules, but there is a hierarchy to find out the one that is applied to it.

## Origins
1. User-agent stylesheets
2. Author stylesheets
3. User stylesheets

## Cascading order
### 1. Relevance
All rules will be filtered from the different sources to keep only the rules that apply to a given element, and that means rules that matches the given element and that are part of the appropriate `@media` rule

### 2. Origin and importance
The those rules are sorted according to their importance, that is, whether or not they are followed by `!important` and by their origin.
#### Order low to high

```
  ORDER          ORIGIN            IMPORTANCE
	1       user-agent(browser)     normal
	2           user                normal
	3         author(developer)     normal
	4         CSS @keyframe animations
	5         autor (developer)     !important
	6            user               !important
	7         user-agent(browser)   !important
	8          CSS transitions
```

For the author styles, priority in increasing order are:
	- external CSS -> can be applied to several files
	- internal CSS -> is applied to a file
	- inline CSS -> is applied to an element


### 3. Specificity
In case of equality with an origin, the [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) of a rule is considered to choose one value or another. The specificity of the selectors are compared, and the declaration with the highest specificity wins.

#### [Selector weight categories](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#selector_weight_categories)

The selector weight categories are listed here in the order of decreasing specificity:

ID column

Includes only [ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors), such as `#example`. For each ID in a matching selector, add 1-0-0 to the weight value.

CLASS column

Includes [class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors), such as `.myClass`, attribute selectors like `[type="radio"]` and `[lang|="fr"]`, and pseudo-classes, such as `:hover`, `:nth-of-type(3n)`, and `:required`. For each class, attribute selector, or pseudo-class in a matching selector, add 0-1-0 to the weight value.

TYPE column

Includes [type selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors), such as `p`, `h1`, and `td`, and pseudo-elements like `::before`, `::placeholder`, and all other selectors with double-colon notation. For each type or pseudo-element in a matching selector, add 0-0-1 to the weight value.

No value

The universal selector ([`*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors)) and the pseudo-class [`:where()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where) and its parameters aren't counted when calculating the weight so their value is 0-0-0, but they do match elements. These selectors do not impact the specificity weight value.

Combinators, such as [`+`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator), [`>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator), [`~`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator), [" "](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator), and [`||`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Column_combinator), may make a selector more specific in what is selected but they don't add any value to the specificity weight.

The negation pseudo-class, [`:not()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not), itself has no weight. Neither do the [`:is()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is) or the [`:has()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) pseudo-classes. The parameters in these selectors, however, do. The values of both come from the parameter in the list of parameters that has the highest specificity. The [`:not()`, `:is()` and `:has()` exceptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#the_is_not_and_has_exceptions) are discussed below.

### 4. Order of appearance
 In the origin with precedence, if there are competing values for a property that are in style block matching selectors of equal specificity, the last declaration in the style order is applied.
