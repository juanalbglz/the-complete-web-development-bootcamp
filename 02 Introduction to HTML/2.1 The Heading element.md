The heading element 
```
starts with an opening tag: <h1> 
and ends with a closing tag: </h1>
```

Headings are hierarchical, that means that they build a tree

They go from H1 to H6

```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 1</h2>
<h3>Heading 1</h3>
<h4>Heading 1</h4>
<h5>Heading 1</h5>
<h6>Heading 1</h6>
```
